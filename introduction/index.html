        Education / Achievements<br>

        IT Experience<br>
        I have basic knowledge of Python and Java, though a little more in Java. <br>
        I have good knowledge of ZShell (MacOS native terminal language) after years <br>
        of utilising Wineskin (a porting toolkit to play Windows games on Mac) and using <br>
        Node.js to setup a local server to run RPGMaker games on browser. This knowledge <br>
        of ZShell got me into Linux and its programming language, Bash, of which I am <br>
        actively training with. I also have some experience in utilising OSINT tools <br>
        for practise investigation and for analysing vulnerabilities. Lastly, I am <br>
        learning the ways of using HTML and CSS for web programming, and SQL for developing <br>
        databases.
